## Python Programming Foundations

### Overview
This repository contains my foundational work in Python programming with a strong emphasis on
**logic building, problem-solving, and clean code practices**.

It is part of my long-term preparation for **BTech CSE (DataScience with ML)** and professional software
engineering roles, focusing on understanding concepts from first principles rather than relying on
shortcuts or high-level abstractions.

---

### Objectives
- Build strong programming logic
- Write readable and maintainable Python code
- Develop problem-solving discipline
- Understand basic time and space complexity
- Avoid premature use of advanced libraries

---

### Tech Stack
- Python 
- Git & GitHub
- VS Code

### Coding Philosophy
- Every problem is solved from scratch
- Logic is explained before implementation
- Code is written for clarity, not cleverness
- Improvements and refactors are done incrementally

---

### Progress Tracking
- [ ] Python basics
- [ ] Control flow
- [ ] Functions and recursion
- [ ] Problem-solving patterns
- [ ] Code refactoring and optimization

### Note
This repository represents my **learning process**, not just final answers.
The focus is on thinking clearly, writing clean code, and improving over time.
